# Given values
pi = 3.14
radius = 84

# Calculate area of the pond
area = pi * (radius ** 2)

# Water per square meter
water_per_sq_meter = 1.4

# Total water in the pond
total_water = area * water_per_sq_meter

# Print results (without decimal point)
print("Area of the pond:", int(area))
print("Total water in the pond (liters):", int(total_water))
